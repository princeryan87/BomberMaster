            "[Prompt Expansion] A warm and lively scene of Indonesian family and friends gathering for *iftar* (breaking fast) during Ramadan. The setting is a beautifully decorated dining area with a large table filled with traditional Ramadan foods and drinks. On the table, there are plates of dates, bowls of soup, fresh salads, grilled meats, rice dishes, and colorful desserts like baklava and kunafa. Glass cups of rosewater sherbet and water are placed neatly. The table is adorned with elegant Ramadan-themed decorations, such as lanterns, crescent moon centerpieces, and fairy lights strung across the room. The room has a cozy, inviting atmosphere with soft golden lighting, creating a warm glow. Large windows in the background show a serene sunset sky with hues of orange, pink, and purple. Outside, a mosque with minarets is faintly visible, illuminated by soft lights. The family and friends are seated around the table, smiling and laughing as they prepare to break their fast. A young boy is reaching for a date, while an elderly man is pouring water for others. A woman is holding a tray of freshly baked bread, and a teenage girl is lighting a lantern. Everyone is dressed in modest, elegant clothing—men in thobes and kufis, women in colorful hijabs and abayas. In the corner, a small child is playing with a Ramadan-themed toy, and a cat is curiously watching the scene. The overall mood is joyful, peaceful, and full of love, capturing the essence of togetherness during Ramadan. Hyper-realistic, detailed, and vibrant. The lighting is soft and warm, with a focus on the textures of the food, fabrics, and decorations. The composition is balanced, with a mix of close-up details and wider shots of the room. Warm, golden hour lighting with soft shadows. Rich, warm tones (gold, orange, red) with accents of blue and green from the decorations. High detail on food, clothing, and decorations to emphasize realism, rich colors, strong dramatic deep light, cinematic, very inspirational, gorgeous, intricate, extremely artistic, inspiring, thought formed, beautiful, perfect, delicate, sharp, amazing, cool, creative\n",
